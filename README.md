# Covid19-Data-Analysis
Covid19 Data Analysis Using Python
## Project Overview

The COVID-19 Data Analysis project involves analyzing publicly available datasets on COVID-19 cases globally. The analysis includes data cleaning, trend analysis, and visualization to track the spread of the virus and forecast future trends.

### Key Tasks:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization (line plots, bar charts, heatmaps)
- Time series forecasting (if applicable)
- Predictive modeling for case trends

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (if applicable).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The dataset contains daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries for countries and regions worldwide.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and transforming the dataset into a usable format.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations include line plots to show the trend of COVID-19 cases over time, heatmaps for country-level comparison, and bar charts for regional analysis.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends in the spread of the virus and analyzing how different regions are affected.
- **Forecasting**: Using time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future case trends.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for machine learning models), etc.
